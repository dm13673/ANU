Confirm that data in LDB make sense. link Chart of outliers in distribution of deaths in age range prior to open age interval (OAI) Check that procedure for smoothing deaths before fitting model to split OAI is reasonable. link Internal consistency checks Chart of total number of deaths by year for IDB versus LDB by sex Total from IDB should match exactly to total in LDB. link Chart of total January 1st population by year for IDB versus LDB by sex Total from IDB should track close to total in LDB. link Chart of deaths within age groups (under 5, 5 to 64, 65 or higher, 85 or higher) by year for IDB versus LDB For each age group specific chart, IDB should track close to LDB. link Chart of population size within age groups (under 5, 5 to 64, 65 or higher, 85 or higher) by year for IDB versus LDB For each age group specific chart, IDB should track close to LDB. link Internal plausibility checks Chart of death rates by age and sex for each year (based on mltper_1x1.csv/fltper_1x1.csv located in output directory for country!!!) Identify strange patterns in death rates for males versus females. link Chart of death rates by year and sex for each age (based on mltper_1x1.csv/fltper_1x1.csv located in output directory for country!!!) Identify strange patterns in death rates for males versus females. link Chart of mortality deviations compared with adiacent ages. Note that the number of neighboring ages and/or years as well as the p-values for X and the size of R can be modified prior to running the batch program. Expect to see large negative deviations at age 1 versus age 0. Patterns of large deviations, e.g., at ages ending in “0” or “5”, may indicate problematic places in the mortality surface. link Lexis map of total net migration. Migration patterns should make sense. Should not show net migration above age 80 (unless there are territorial changes). link External plausibility checks Chart of total net migration by calendar year and sex Might be used to check that pattern of implied migration is consistent with any available migration data. link Chart of life expectancy at ages 0, 65, and 80 by sex compared to Sweden Might be used to check pattern of life expectancy with Sweden as the benchmark. link Internal consistency of old vs. new data Chart of ratio of new vs. old raw and adjusted mortality rates in life table data Might be used to locate large discrepancies between old and new data. CS should look at graphs in 16 and 17 to understand whether differences are due to changes in numerators, denominators, or both. link Chart of ratio of new vs. old death counts in Lexis databse Might be used to locate large discrepancies between old and new data. link Chart of ratio of new vs. old population counts in Lexis database Might be used to locate large discrepancies between old and new data. link Chart of mortality sex ratio surface link "],

But d_soainew() in R does not output the outlier information or plot any graphs and it is not clear just how that routine will change in the future. It is not MP-compliant and proceeds in an ad-hoc fashion. The strategy now is to slap together as a PDF all of the outl/*.png images in the LexisDB/outl/ folder (produced by Matlab scripts).
